== Code analysis and Metrics

These are services that evaluate a given code repo and create some ancillary material for it.  For example, a service might compute various metrics (code coverage for a test suite, etc), project management and alerts (for example, it sends a message to a chat service when someone commits), documentation (rebuilds automated docs on each commit), etc.  These are often implemented as webhooks within a CI server (Jenkins, etc) or in the VCS (like a GitHub service hook).
