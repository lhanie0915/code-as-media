== Structured Sandbox

These sites, which are typically geared towards learning a specific language or tool, provides a guided introduction using a live code sandbox.  For example, you're asked to declare a variable of a certain type, compute a certain value, or perform some task on a data structure (like reverse an array).  Typically, these steps are executed using some sort of testing suite to confirm that the user performed the task.

* Strengths
** Highly interactive.  A user usually cannot progress until they've successfully completed the coding step.
** Granularly structured.  The courses are usually very well structured, based around tasks or specific excercises.
** Game-ifable.  It's very simple to award badges and whatnot based on completion. 
* Weaknesses
** Complex to develop.  The test suites require a specialized author who can write the tests.
** Rigid.  These tend towards lowest common demoninator topics that can only be expressed in simple, step-by-step tasks

Examples include:

=== Codecademy 

http://www.codecademy.com/[Codecademy] offers tutorials in JavaScript, Python and Ruby.  The tutorials are very tightly structured into small chunks, each with an associated action (like defining a string).  The author uses their custom CMS to create both the narrative material as well as the "unit tests" that describe the correct answer.  While the classes have generated a lot of buzz and garnered many signups, they have a high incompletion rate.

=== Code School (Rails for Zombies, Try Objective-C, etc,)

http://tryobjectivec.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1[CodeSchool], like codecademy, provides guided tours through various languages.  Unlike CodeSchool, each course or class is individually branded.  For example, the jQuery class has an Airline/adventure feel, while the http://tryobjectivec.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1[Objective-C] class has a retro videogame theme.

.CodeSchools jQuery Class.  Note the traditional layout.

=== Try Redis

http://try.redis.io/[Try Redis!] walks you through the redis database.  The interface is purely text based, making it feel a bilt like an old text adventure game, like Zork.
