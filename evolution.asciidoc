== Code evolution

These show how code changes or progresses over time.  For example, you might break a complex example down into a series of steps.  At each change point, you show how the code changes.

=== Text-based description

"Tech book approach" -- have a narrative series of listing that shows the code at each point and describes the changes made.


=== Meteor book

Uses commits at each checkpoint so that the user can check out a commit that corresponds to a specific section of the example
