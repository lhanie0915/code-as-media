== Code evolution

Examples in this category show how code evolves over time.  For example, you might break a complex example down into a series of steps.  At each change point, you show how the code progresses between steps.

=== Text-based description

This is the standard tech book approach -- have a narrative series of listing that shows the code at each point, and describes the changes between each.  There's no particular figure required for this.

=== Meteor book

http://www.discovermeteor.com/[The Meteor Book] has a nice system that uses commits at each checkpoint so that the user can check out the code that corresponds to a specific section of the example.  The nice thing about this method is that it allows the author make changes in a natural way that is similar to how they would work with code.
