== Sharing

The sharing category covers different ways that people share code to others (duh!).  They can range from simple (like posting something on a blog) to complex, but the basic idea is that these are ways people send out snippets or full worked examples and get feedback.

=== Blogging / Static site

=== GitHub

=== JSBin / JSFiddle
