== Projects

This chapter contains interesting projects that illustrate patterns described in  prior chapters and show interesting examples of new ways people are learning to code.  (Versus using a plain old book or reference website.)  If you find a new project, add it here and try to note what is interesting about it, and which (if any) of the patterns it uses.

=== Coderpad

http://coderpad.io/[CoderPad] is a <<structured_sandbox, structured sandbox>> that allows two people to share screens (presumably, a interviewer and a job candidate.)  It's built using https://github.com/replit/jsrepl[jsrepl], which powers a few other sites, like udemy and (I think, at least in an earlier incarnation) codecademy.

=== Nature of Code

http://natureofcode.com/[Nature of Code] is Dan Shiffman's interactive book on modeling natural systems in Processing.  It's got a number of really cool features:

* Running processing sketches that are sourced in at build time
* An open github repo for contributors at https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code[shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code]
* An innovative payment system that allows you to set your own price

=== pythonmonk

http://pythonmonk.com/[pythonmonk] is a free, interactive tutorials to help you learn Python in your browser.  It uses an <<unstructured_sandbox, unstructured sandbox>> approach to guide you through a series of lessons.  It's free.

=== voxeljs

http://voxeljs.com/[voxeljs] is a javascript-based minecraft clone.  It's a wonderful, sprawling project that has a game player, creature creators, world editors, and project sharing.  It's not a documentation project so much as it is an example of an emerging application, but it's so cool that we need to pay attention to.

=== Versal
https://versal.com/[Versal] is in beta.


Learning gadgets
Beyond video. Beyond slide decks. Versal brings interactivity to online learning through customizable exercises called “gadgets.”

Drag and drop gadgets – simulations, charts and so much more - right into your course, no coding required.

And if you do know how to code? Our JavaScript API will be available to developers soon. Sign up for an invite.

Are you a JavaScript developer?
Are you intrigued by how interactivity will reinvent online learning?

We’ll be opening up our gadget platform/APIs very soon, and we're looking for a handful of creative developers and early adopters. Sign up for an invite and we'll be in touch shortly.
